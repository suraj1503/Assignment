# Hypermart Checkout System

A responsive queue management simulation built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion**.  
The system distributes customers across checkout counters based on the total number of items each counter is currently handling.

## Features

- Add a customer with a selected number of items (1–30)  
- Smart allocation to the **least-loaded** checkout counter  
- Only the **first customer** in a counter can be removed  
- Smooth animations using **Framer Motion**  
- Fully responsive UI with **Tailwind CSS**

## Time Complexity

### 1. `findNextCheckout(checkouts: CheckoutQueue[])`

Selects the checkout counter with the minimum total items.

```ts
const index = findNextCheckout(checkouts);
```

-  **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`  
  _Where `n` = number of checkout counters (usually small and fixed)._

### 2. Calculating total items per counter:

```ts
queue.customers.reduce((acc, customer) => acc + customer.items, 0);
```

-  **Time Complexity:** `O(m)`  
  _Where `m` = number of customers in the counter._

**Overall insertion complexity:** `O(n * m)` — efficient for typical small-scale use.

---

## Assumptions

- Fixed number of counters (e.g., 3).  
- Only the **first customer** in each queue can be removed manually.  
- No backend or persistent storage (no Redis/localStorage).  
- No auto-removal of customers/items after timeout; removal is manual only.
